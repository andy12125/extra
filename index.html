<p>Howdy, my name is Andy Ngo and I go to <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/v">Texas A&M University</a>, majoring in <a href="https://eahr.tamu.edu/academics/technology-management/">Technology Management</a>. This is the first website I've ever created, so it won't be professionally made. Content will be about me and my history including other information that will be relevant to this website. The color scheme is from my favorite color blue because I find the color very calming to look at. The pictures above are me and my cat. The first photo was taken in <a href="https://www.dfwi.org/">Downtown Fort Worth</a> while I was hanging out with my family and friends. The second photo was taken when my cat was sleepy which I found very cute! His name is Felix and he's a orange tabby. My cat loves to play with sticks and loves to eat a lot, but I try and watch how much he eats. I got him about a year ago at the animal shelter because I always wanted to take care of an animal and I really like cats.</p>

<p>Next, I'd like to discuss about my thoughts and goals in life. There are many things I'd like to do after I finish college such as traveling around the world and meet new people. I hope in the future I can work in a major technological company like <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> or Microsoft as an IT manager. Currently, I'm trying my best in college to learn about new technologies and how they work, but it's difficult managing everything by yourself. This journey will be be tough and I'm ready for anything comes at me. I think that's what makes me independent allowing me to gain more life experience to use when I enter the workforce. I knew college won't be easy and knowing that I spent a lot of time planning and studying. I have to figure out what I need to do to succeed and look for oppurtunities to get where I want to be. However, I do worry if what I'm actually doing is right, but I know that I'm giving my all! </p>
