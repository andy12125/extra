<p>Currently, I am working hard to graduate early, so I can work towards my master's degree. With <b>this</b> degree, I feel like I'll have a better chance at getting the job I want in the future. As I said before, I would like to work in a major technological company though I do have my doubts about how to get there. I still have a lot to learn about the new technology and how to work with them. Along with a master's, I will have to find a internship that meets the correct requirements giving new skills and understanding of the work force. Sometimes I do feel like I am pushing myself too much, but I have certain reasons to why I'm doing as much as I can now. For example, during my high school days I played around too much and after reflecting on my actions I knew I had to change when I get to college. </p>

<p>I really love using technology such as my iPad Pro and laptop. I use my iPad to do digital drawings because it's one of my hobbies though I'm still learning. Another hobby <i>that</i> I have is cooking which I can make tons of different dishes from various amounts of countries. I tend to take <u>pictures</u> of the foods I made and even the simple ones like a loaded baked potato. With these hobbies, I want to keep getting better at them because I know I can use them in the future or as a job if I can't get one at a technology company. Even though I do enjoy doing these hobbies, I don't have the time to attend to them since college is time consuming and tedious. So right now I'll have to put a hold on the things I want to do and put as much focus I can for my degree. </p>
